The 4th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2017 - http://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 22-23 2017 in Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is co-located with the industry exposition Robonumerique (http://www.robonumerique.fr).

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud may complement robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial intelligence. As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary, the session aims at building a bridge between experts from academia and industry working in different fields, such as robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things and distributed cloud systems.

The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on the integration of Internet-of-Things with robots (leading to the so-called Internet of Robotic Things), as well as one industry session.
A selected set of papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Software Engineering for Robotics (http://www.joser.org).

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not necessarily limited to:

- Architectures and middleware solutions for cyber-physical systems, integrating the IoT, the cloud/edge with robots and other actuators
- Distributed sensing, planning and actuation
- Cloud-based control systems, possibly using deterministic wireless or wired networking
- Domain Specific Languages for cloud robotics and cyber-physical systems
- Software engineering practices for networked robots
- Tele-robotic systems
- Computational offloading and load balancing in robotics
- Multi-robot coordination and orchestration
- Self-adaptive cyber-physical and robotic systems
- Cloud-supported collective knowledge and parameter sharing between actuation systems
- Sensor fusion for improved control policies
- Transfer learning between tasks or across robotic systems
- Hands-on experiences and use cases in the fields of manufacturing, Industry 4.0, healthcare, active assisted living, logistics and transportation, security and surveillance, precision agriculture and others.

## Submission

Three categories of submissions are solicited:

* full papers, presenting research results, limited to 6 pages in 2-column conference paper format
* application papers (short papers 2-4 pages), presenting lessons learnt during practical field trials and/or with commercial applications in the domain of cloud robotics and cyber-physical systems
* presentations, expressing industry viewpoints and requirements that may help in shaping future research agenda. Prospective presenters should submit a short abstract describing the content of their presentation
