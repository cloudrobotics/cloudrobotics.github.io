The 4th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2017 - http://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 22-23 2017 in Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is co-located with the industry exposition Robonumerique (http://www.robonumerique.fr).

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud may complement robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial intelligence. As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary, the session aims at building a bridge between experts from academia and industry working in different fields, such as roboticists, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things and distributed cloud systems.

The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on the integration of Internet-of-Things with robots (leading to the so-called Internet of Robotic Things), as well as one industry session.

## Industry section

The ICCR 2017 Conference is your opportunity to gain visibility for your technologies and research, and to advertise them to the best researchers and students in the field. The goal of industry talks is to highlight state-of-the-art developments, taking the audience behind the scenes to present new ideas that are still in progress or to demonstrate how robotics techniques are actually implemented and used. Industry contributors in robotics-related fields are invited to submit presentations in the following non restrictive list of areas:

- Architectures and middleware solutions for cyber-physical systems, integrating the IoT, the cloud/edge with robots and other actuators
- Distributed sensing, planning and actuation
- Cloud-based control systems, possibly using deterministic wireless or wired networking
- Domain Specific Languages for cloud robotics and cyber-physical systems
- Software engineering practices for networked robots
- Tele-robotic systems
- Computational offloading and load balancing in robotics
- Multi-robot coordination and orchestration
- Self-adaptive cyber-physical and robotic systems
- Cloud-supported collective knowledge and parameter sharing between actuation systems
- Sensor fusion for improved control policies
- Transfer learning between tasks or across robotic systems
- Hands-on experiences and use cases in the fields of manufacturing, Industry 4.0, healthcare, active assisted living, logistics and transportation, security and surveillance, precision agriculture and others.

## Submission

We seek technical presentations rather than marketing-oriented talks. The duration of the presentation can be either 20 or 45mn (this could be adjusted) plus a period for questions.

The submission should be sent to the industrial seminars chairs by email (cloudrobotics.iccr@gmail.com), in form of a one page PDF abstract describing the proposed presentation.

Note that these presentations are not considered archival publications and are compatible with future submission of peer-reviewed publications.

The deadline for submission is October 23, 2017.

Decision about acceptance will be notify on October 30, 2017.

For further information please contact the co-chairs: cloudrobotics.iccr@gmail.com.
