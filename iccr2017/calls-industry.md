The 4th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2017 - http://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 22-23 2017 in Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is co-located with the industry exposition Robonumerique (http://www.robonumerique.fr).

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud may complement robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial intelligence. As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary, the session aims at building a bridge between experts from academia and industry working in different fields, such as robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things and distributed cloud systems.

## Industry Session

The ICCR 2017 Conference is your opportunity to gain visibility for your technologies and research, and to advertise them to researchers and students in the field. The goal of industry talks is to highlight state-of-the-art developments, taking the audience behind the scenes to present new ideas that are still in progress or to demonstrate how robotics techniques are actually implemented and used in conjunction with cloud and IoT technologies. You can present hands-on experiences and use cases in the fields of manufacturing, Industry 4.0, healthcare, active assisted living, logistics and transportation, security and surveillance, precision agriculture and others.

Topics should align with the theme of the conference, namely cyber-physical systems integrating the IoT, the cloud/edge with robots and other actuators. This year we will also devote special attention to precision agriculture.

## Submission

We seek technical presentations rather than marketing-oriented talks. The duration of the presentation can be either 20 or 45 min. Submissions should be sent through the EasyChair online submission tool. https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccr17

Note that these presentations are not considered archival publications and are compatible with future submission of peer-reviewed publications.

The deadline for submission is October 23, 2017.
Notifications of acceptance will be circulated by October 30, 2017.
