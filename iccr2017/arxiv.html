        <h1>ICCR 2017: International Conference on Cloud and Robotics</h1>
    
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>The 4th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2017 - http://www.cloudrobotics.info/iccr2017/home.html)
            held on November 22-23 2017 in Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is co-located with the industry exposition Robonumerique
            (http://www.robonumerique.fr). </p>
        <p>The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage and communication resources provided by
            the cloud. The cloud may complement robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases,
            context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial intelligence.
            As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary, the session aims at building a bridge between experts from
            academia and industry working in different fields, such as robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software
            architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things and distributed cloud systems.

        <h2>Regular papers presented at the conference</h2>
        <p>Six papers were accepted at the conference. All submitted regular papers were reviewed by at least three members of the
            program committee. The conference was attended by the researchers/practitioners from various domains in robotics, Cloud
            computing, software engineering and IoT. The conference faciliated the discussion and exchange between robotics and Cloud computing,
            and furthermore builded a base for future collaboration.</p>
