The 4th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2017 - http://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 22-23 2017 in Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is co-located with the industry exposition Robonumerique (http://www.robonumerique.fr).

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud may complement robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial intelligence. As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary, the session aims at building a bridge between experts from academia and industry working in different fields, such as robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things and distributed cloud systems.

The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on the integration of Internet-of-Things with robots (leading to the so-called Internet of Robotic Things), as well as one industry session.
