The 6th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2022 - https://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on March 06 2022 in Paris, France.

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation,
storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud
may complement robotic resources in several ways, including
crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational
offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial
intelligence. Today, the paradigms of cloud/fog/edge computing propose
software architecture solutions for robots to share computations or
offload them to ambiant and networked resources. Yet, combining
distant computations with the real time constraints of robotics is
very challenging. As the challenges in this domain are
multi-disciplinary and similar in other research areas, Cloud Robotics
aims at building bridges among experts from academia and industry
working in different fields, such as robotics, cyber-physical systems,
automotive, aerospace, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things,
networked control and distributed cloud systems.

The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on Robotics in
Medicine, as well as one industry session.

- Cloud/Fog/Edge-based control systems, possibly using deterministic
  wireless or wired networking.

- Networked control with application to cloud/fog/edge robotic and
  cyber-physical systems.

- Computational offloading and load balancing in robotics.

- Distributed sensing, planning and actuation.

- Distributed sensor fusion for improved control policies.

- Self-adaptive networked cyber-physical and robotic systems.

- Cloud-supported collective knowledge and parameter sharing between
  actuation systems.

- Transfer and shared learning between tasks or across robotic systems.
