**ICCR 2019: International Conference on Cloud and Robotics.**

<span style="color: blue">**Submitted to arXiv**</span>


### Preface

The 6th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2019
- https://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 13-14 2019 in
Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is a co-event with the industry exposition
Robonumerique (https://www.robomeetings.fr). 


The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation, storage
and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud may complement
robotic resources in several ways, including crowd-sourcing knowledge databases,
context information, computational offloading or data-intensive information
processing for artificial intelligence. Today, the paradigms of cloud/fog/edge
computing propose software architecture solutions for robots to share
computations or offload them to ambiant and networked resources. Yet, combining
distant computations with the real time constraints of robotics is very
challenging. As the challenges in this domain are multi-disciplinary and similar
in other research areas, Cloud Robotics aims at building bridges among experts
from academia and industry working in different fields, such as robotics,
cyber-physical systems, automotive, aerospace, machine learning, artificial
intelligence, software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things,
networked control and distributed cloud systems. 


The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on Robotics in medicine,
as well as one industry session.
