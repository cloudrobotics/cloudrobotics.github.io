The 5th edition of the International Conference on Cloud and Robotics (ICCR 2018 - http://cloudrobotics.info) will be held on November 12-14 2018 in Paris and Saint-Quentin, France. The conference is a co-event with GDR ALROB and the industry exposition Robonumerique (http://www.robonumerique.fr).

The domain of cloud robotics aims to converge robots with computation,
storage and communication resources provided by the cloud. The cloud
may complement robotic resources in several ways, including
crowd-sourcing knowledge databases, context information, computational
offloading or data-intensive information processing for artificial
intelligence. Today, the paradigms of cloud/fog/edge computing propose
software architecture solutions for robots to share computations or
offload them to ambiant and networked resources. Yet, combining
distant computations with the real time constraints of robotics is
very challenging.  As the challenges in this domain are
multi-disciplinary and similar in other research areas, Cloud Robotics
aims at building bridges among experts from academia and industry
working in different fields, such as robotics, cyber-physical systems,
automotive, aerospace, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
software architecture, big data analytics, Internet-of-Things,
networked control and distributed cloud systems.

The conference is organizing two special sessions: one on Robotics in
Agriculture, as well as one industry session.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not necessarily limited to:

- Architectures and middleware solutions for cyber-physical systems,
  integrating the IoT, the cloud/fog/edge with robots and other
  actuators.

- Software engineering practices for networked robotic and
  cyber-physical systems.

- Domain Specific Languages for cloud robotics and cyber-physical
  systems.

- Tele-robotic systems.

- Multi-robot coordination and orchestration.

- Cloud/Fog/Edge-based control systems, possibly using deterministic
  wireless or wired networking.

- Networked control with application to cloud/fog/edge robotic and
  cyber-physical systems.

- Computational offloading and load balancing in robotics.

- Distributed sensing, planning and actuation.

- Distributed sensor fusion for improved control policies.

- Self-adaptive networked cyber-physical and robotic systems.

- Cloud-supported collective knowledge and parameter sharing between
  actuation systems.

- Transfer and shared learning between tasks or across robotic systems.

- Hands-on experiences and use cases in the fields of manufacturing,
  Industry 4.0, healthcare, active assisted living, logistics and
  transportation, security and surveillance, precision agriculture,
  smart grids, smart cities and others.

## Submission

Three categories of submissions are solicited:

* full papers, presenting research results, limited to 6 pages in 2-column conference paper format
* application papers (short papers 2-4 pages), presenting lessons learnt during practical field trials and/or with commercial applications in the domain of cloud robotics and cyber-physical systems
* presentations, expressing industry viewpoints and requirements that may help in shaping future research agenda. Prospective presenters should submit a short abstract describing the content of their presentation
