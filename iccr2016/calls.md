ICCR is the premier gathering of practitioners and researchers interested in how to apply Cloud computing in robotics. The objective of ICCR is a working conference, where togethers Cloud computing and robotics researchers and where discusses how Cloud computing applies and changes robotics and so influences the future of robotics. Different with traditional academic conference, ICCR is also a forum for researchers and practitioners in the two disciplines, fostering the collaboration of Cloud computing with robotics, and for practitioners to show their working projects and to discuss and exchange their problems with researchers to find a solution.

Cloud robotics is a field of robotics that attempts to invoke Cloud technologies such as Cloud computing, Cloud storage, and other Internet technologies centered around the benefits of converged infrastructure and shared services for robotics. In a few short years, Cloud robotics as a newly emerged field has already received much research and industrial attention. The use of the Cloud for robotics and automation brings some potential benefits largely ameliorating the performance of robotic systems.

## Topics of interest include, but are not necessarily limited to :

- Cloud computing for robots
- Web services for robots
- Telerobotics
- Architecture of Cloud robotic systems
- Cloud robotics design
- DSL for Cloud robotics
- Software engineering for robotics

## Types of submissions

Papers should describe results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or experimental research and industrial practice in Cloud computing, Web services or Robotics.

- Full papers are limited to 6 proceedings pages. We especially welcome submissions of papers addressing practical evaluation and industrial application, as well as innovative approaches and ideas discussing emerging challenges.
- Short papers are limited to 4 proceedings pages, (i.e., a position paper describing specific questions and issues that the participants feel should be addressed; a demo paper describing a demonstration; a technical communication aimed at describing recent developments, and new projects that are not ready for publication as regular papers).
- Published papers will be accepted for discussion, but not be included in proceeding.

## Formatting and Submission Instructions

All papers must conform, at time of submission, to the IEEE Formatting Guidelines, use the letter page format, and be submitted electronically through the Easychair Online Submission Site by choosing academic or student topic.
